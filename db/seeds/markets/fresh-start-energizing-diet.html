<p>We all have that "time." You know, when your energy levels dip and you feel sluggish, cranky and ravenously hungry. Perhaps that time for you is 3 pm, perhaps it's 10 am, perhaps it happens more than once a day.</p>
<p>Think about it. Now that you've committed yourself to the Start Fresh! Raw-Detox Diet &hellip;how in heck are you going to survive Monday morning without your coffee &ndash; loaded to the rim with heavy cream and toxic sugar?</p>
<p>And what about Wednesday afternoon, when that bag of chips hidden in your desk drawer starts taunting you?</p>
<p>You're so used to the toxic, processed sweet and salty 'treats' giving you a momentary boost to get you through the last couple of hours of work&hellip;</p>
<p>How can you survive without your good 'ole standby snacks?</p>
<p>Before becoming a raw foodie, I relied on a chocolate bar to power through my 3pm wall. Of course I'd crash again by the time I got home from work, but that toxic, processed snack perked me up just long enough to get me through those last two hours.</p>
<p>Once I had committed to a raw detox-diet and finally got myself on a healthy track, I quickly had to find new foods that would give me the energy I needed.</p>
<p>After researching online, reading raw food books and speaking with a raw food nutritionist, I've made a condensed list of all the superfoods that will get you through any wall &ndash; whether it's your everyday workday wall, a late night/early morning combination, a stressful day, a strenuous morning workout &ndash; whatever you need that extra kick to get through, I've got the superfood for you.</p>
<p>Now Introducing the</p>
<h1>Start Fresh! Energizing Diet</h1>
<p><br /> Inside the Start Fresh! Energizing Diet you will find the 13 superfoods you need to have fully stocked in your pantry at all times. This is the best way to fight temptation and feel energized throughout the day.</p>
<p>Here's an exclusive sneak peek of just 3 of the 13 energy-boosting superfoods:</p>
<h1>Hemp</h1>
<p>Both hemp seeds and hemp oil are great sources of essential amino acids that help repair muscle tissue. These will improve your metabolism, increase your energy levels, lower cholesterol levels, enhance immune activity, and reduce food cravings&hellip;</p>
<h1>Quinoa</h1>
<p>Not only is quinoa high in complete proteins with all nine essential amino acids, but it is also a very good source of manganese, magnesium, iron, copper, phosphorous, and B vitamins&hellip;</p>
<h1>Kale</h1>
<p>Kale is an important source of iron, more so than meat, and out bodies need iron to maintain a consistent energy level throughout the day. You'll be hard‚Äêpressed to find a better source of vitamins A, C and K, so try to mix it into your diet whenever you can&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, the list of 13 superfoods will be very helpful during and after your Start Fresh! Raw-Detox Diet&hellip; but that's not all that I've included. I've also added in 16 recipes (4 breakfast, 4 lunch, 4 dinner and 4 smoothie recipes)!</p>
