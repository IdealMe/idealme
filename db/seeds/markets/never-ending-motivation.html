<h1 class="text-center">"Discover The Secret to
	Never-Ending Motivation!"</h1>

<h2 class="text-italic text-center">Have you ever set a goal only to find yourself setting the same one over and
	over again?</h2>

<p class="text-italic text-center">Great News! There's an easy solution to the common trend of not achieving your
	goals. You simply have to realize that it's your motivation that goes missing and determine which of the
	Motivation Assassinators is the one that has most often gotten hold of you!</p>

<p>Dear Friend,</p>

<p>Since 1986, I've helped millions maintain their motivation for everything from weight loss to financial
	success.</p>

<p>More than 85 percent of us make New Year's resolutions, but almost none of us actually keep them for more than a
	few weeks.</p>

<p>The good news is that it doesn't have to be that way. The even better news is that <strong>it's not your
	fault</strong>. It's simply that life happens and your motivation gets zapped.</p>

<p>Proof---- have you ever set a goal, been TOTALLY excited about it, ready to go and just sure it would happen...
	only to look up a week or month later to see that you weren't following the plan at all? THEN... you went for it
	again at yet another time. This time you were 'ready'. You were sure you'd do it this time. Again, two weeks
	passed and you weren't working on the goal anymore!</p>

<p>It's not that the plan you were using didn't work. It's that your motivation went missing. You can actually keep
	the resolutions you make and achieve the goals you set once you know how to maintain the motivation you had when
	you started out.</p>

<p>I lived through it. I learned from it. And then I created a system that anyone can use to meet adversity head on,
	and overcome it rather than have it overcome you. Thus dreams are achieved and you accomplish the goals you
	set.</p>

<p>As I studied all the different goal setting programs, took part in many and read the books, I found out there was
	a BIG piece missing... or at least not much focused on. That piece was, "What holds us back from achieving the
	goal?" All of us set out to achieve big goals, and are ENORMOUSLY EXCITED about doing so, and then something
	stops us.</p>

<p><strong>Never Ending Motivation addresses what keeps us from achieving the goals we set.</strong></p>

<h2>IN THIS PROGRAM YOU WILL LEARN:</h2>

<p><strong>Never Ending Motivation CD1</strong></p>

<p><strong>You Can Defeat Your Motivation Assassinators!</strong></p>

<p>In this audio you'll meet those dastardly Motivation Assassinators and discover which ones have been coming
	against you and your goals. Incredible insider and immediately usable info is revealed even in this first
	portion. Use the notes and workbook to begin to recognize when your motivation starts to come up missing and
	start to watch it become never-ending!</p>

<p><strong>Never Ending Motivation CD2</strong></p>

<p><strong>Maintain Focus and Build Belief</strong></p>

<p>Focus (or I should say lack thereof) is the number one culprit that destroys our motivation.</p>

<p>Belief is, in reality, the most powerful of all the Assassinators because our belief determines everything about
	us, our lives and what takes place in both. What many don't know is that you can actually retrain your brain so
	your mind believes you are the exact individual you long to be. During this audio, transcript and workbook
	you'll learn simple strategies for uncovering the key to your laser-like focus and retraining your brain.</p>

<p>Listen in as 2 of the world's most renowned experts on focus and belief share timeless wisdom and specific tools
	and techniques to help you maintain your motivation.</p>

<p><strong>Never Ending Motivation CD3</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overcome Negative Habits</strong></p>

<p>During this section we discover how we go through our day without realizing the things we think are occurring do
	to default mode are not at all occurring from default, but from actual choices! You'll learn how to see a habit
	that has kept you from your goals for years simply because you didn't realize it was a habit. (There not the
	ones you may think) Once realized, habits can be altered quite easily... one step at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Never Ending Motivation CD4</strong></p>

<p><strong>Keep Emotional Reactions From Controlling You</strong></p>

<p>Stress is often a reason we give up a goal. Perhaps frustration with the lack of progress caused you to throw in
	the towel. Maybe boredom or depression stopped your progress. Emotional reaction can also cause us to reward
	ourselves incorrectly. We spend too much, or eat too much of the wrong stuff, we drink too much or go overboard
	in another area. Join in as renowned expert Dr. Jeffery Wilbert shares how far too often emotions direct and
	control our lives (and our goal attainment). Discover a step-by-step process for turning emotional reactions
	into responses and personal growth... both weapons for defeating the Motivation Assassinators.</p>

<p><strong>Never Ending Motivation CD5</strong></p>

<p><strong>Build Positive Surroundings and Find More Time</strong></p>

<p>We all have a Fist Factor. If you open your hand and look at the palm and then make a fist, you will see that
	those 5 fingers became quite powerful, yes? Well, so it is true with the Fist Factor. In your Fist Factor reside
	the 5 people you spend the most time with. They hold the most power of influence over you. It takes 6 positive
	relationships to sustain a human being and we need 20 positives to overcome 1 negative. Discover how to build
	these life-giving relationships.</p>

<p>In a world where we can all be quite frazzled finding more time is invaluable! The content of this call will
	actually ADD twenty working weeks into your year! Wow, 20 weeks to do with what you will! Imagine! You're going
	to be surprised at how easy it is to find this time.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="text-italic"><p>Dear Donna,</p>

	<p>I didn't know that I had a problem with motivation. I just thought it was bad luck or circumstance and I just
		wasn't supposed to achieve the goals I set.</p>

	<p>I set and let it pass again. And here goes another year that I have resolved to finally lose my weight and it
		just didn't happen. By the end of January I'd lose my motivation. Once I found out the problem was a
		motivation assassinator and it was causing me to believe that I couldn't even lose it in the first place,
		THEN I could actually lose the weight.</p>

	<p><strong>Understanding the Motivation Assassinators took all the pressure off me. It took away the guilt and
		blame I would feel when I didn't achieve a goal or keep a resolution. I didn't feel like a failure because
		it empowered me to overcome those obstacles in front of me... before that I never realized I had
		them.</strong></p>

	<p>You showed my there is hope. It wasn't me! It wasn't circumstance or bad luck and I was definitely not a
		failure. There are actually these motivation assassinators that are set in place for us to not achieve our
		goals. Go figure out which one is holding you back... because once you defeat them there's no holding back!!
		You're going to be able to achieve every single goal that you set for yourself now to eternity."</p>

	<p><strong>Missy</strong></p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div class="text-italic"><p>Dear Donna,</p>

	<p>Once you realize what these motivation assassinators are and you address which one's getting in the way,
		that's when it really starts to make a difference.</p>

	<p>You start seeing yourself setting goals and achieving things that you never thought possible! I got away from
		a negative relationship and got into a great one that I've been in for over a year now! I have moved up in
		my career. I've been able to learn how to maintain some friendships that were long distance. I've lost 35
		pounds. I went from a size 16 to a size 9/10! I was able to get a new car. And I learned how to save
		money.</p>

	<p><strong>I can't begin to put a price tag on the value of this information.</strong></p>

	<p>I mean, seriously I'm making twice what I was before. I have the ability to make as much money as I want.
		Words can't explain, it just made so much difference in my life. And not only my life but the people around
		me because it taught me how to help them and there's so many things that everyone can gain just by figuring
		out what is holding them back. No More Motivation Assassinators!</p>

	<p><strong>Elisha</strong></p></div>  </blockquote>
<blockquote><div class="text-italic"><p>Donna,</p>

	<p>I faced FOUR cancers, two with zero percent cure rates, and I faced head on the reality and challenge of
		maintaining motivation. I went into the hospital on Friday mornings and for 5 days, 24 hours a day and would
		receive what they called VIP chemo.</p>

	<p>I knew I should have been exercising, journaling and all those other goal-oriented things, but the Motivation
		Assassinators kept it from happening- for a minute- they almost got me!</p>

	<p>After the series of chemo ended I was told should the cancer return again, the cure rate would be zero.</p>

	<p>With Never Ending Motivation people receive the very same information I used to sustain motivation when we
		heard the words for the second time, "If this cancer comes back... there is zero chance for cure. "</p>

<h2 class="text-center">You CAN find and MAINTAIN your motivation. And the great news is it's really quite
	simple.</h2>

<p>There are only 7 enemies that come against our motivation... always... only seven... and they are quite
	recognizable once you know what they are. They are powerful, that is UNTIL you identify them and then they can
	be rendered powerless! If you could FINALLY and truly know how to maintain motivation you WOULD achieve your
	goals.</p>

<p><strong>Imagine what goals you will achieve when you know how to...</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Have laser-like focus and eliminate distractions</li>
	<li>Possess an absolute certainty that you were created for victory</li>
	<li>Erase defeating habits from your life</li>
	<li>Destroy depression, boredom, anger or worry</li>
	<li>Have all the energy you need</li>
	<li>Build life-giving personal and professional relationships into your life</li>
	<li>FIND MORE TIME to do the things you want to do!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><div class="text-italic"><p>Dear Donna,</p>

	<p>People have had exponential business growth, personal incomes multiplying sometimes by 10 times, peace of
		mind, they end up loving the work they do, permanent weight loss, they make a positive mark on the world,
		they create a magnetic presence in their community, they put passion back in their marriage, they get
		closeness with their children or their siblings, they find more time in their day, halleluiah.</p>

	<p>When we met I told you, "I hate to set goals. I have a hard time setting goals." You told me there are some
		things that come against you every time you try to that are stopping you."</p>

	<p><strong>Now, I believe... period. After doing just one thing I began to see myself as what I wanted to become
		and I became it!</strong></p>

	<p>Instead of seeing myself as a person who's afraid of doing everything, I now have complete confidence! And
		this just encourages me to go for other dreams to, I'm not stopping here!</p>

	<p>With Complete Confidence,</p>

	<p><strong>Joy</strong></p></div>     </blockquote>
<h1 class="text-center">The Truth Is MOTIVATION CAN BE MAINTAINED.</h1>

<p>The most common problem with making resolutions is that we think it will be quick and easy to change behavior
	because we have a new program or system to follow. Our enthusiasm is high! We say, "It will work this time."
	What we forget is that we've made this resolution before. But if our excitement was enough to carry us, we
	wouldn't need to make the resolution again, right? Something in our life kills that motivation.</p>

<p>The result is that we keep our resolutions for only a little while. This doesn't have to happen. You can maintain
	your motivation.</p>

<p>You can maintain motivation even when business stress is peaked, when nothing's going as you want it to and it
	seems failure is eminent!</p>

<p>I decided to become a business owner and entered with not one penny of my own. To say I was scared is an
	understatement! I was terrified! Failure seemed certain. Later as the companies grew I encountered issues I had
	no idea how to handle. Again, I faced numerous times when I wondered if the stress would destroy everything
	because it would destroy me. Many years later, after uncovering how to maintain motivation, I now realize this
	was nothing more than the Motivation Assassinators at work. Since then my businesses have done nothing but
	EXPLODE with success!</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="text-italic"><p>Dear Donna,</p>

	<p>At first, the truth is I found myself running in circles because I'd say, "Okay, it's this Assassinator," and
		then, No, it's that one." I felt like I was trying to defeat them all at once, all over the place...like the
		game "Whack-a-Mole."</p>

	<p>And then you said,<strong>"When you get that focus... when you have a powerful enough focus... those other
		ones will no longer be able to attack you. They'll be powerless."</strong></p>

	<p>So, I grabbed on to that piece of information and found my focus of what it was that I wanted to accomplish,
		truly accomplish.</p>

	<p>I narrowed it down piece by piece and week by week saying, "If I'm not doing this in a week it's not
		important enough."And then I'd go on to find what it was I really wanted to accomplish.</p>

	<p>This gave me focus as if I had blinders on. None of the rest have power over me now, I am focused.</p>

	<p>Thank You,</p>

<h1 class="text-center">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

<p><strong>"I've tried so many goals programs. I'm still not at my goal. What makes this one different?"</strong>
</p>

<p>We understand, it's frustrating to plan on achieving something only to find yourself having to make the same plan
	again later. Goals programs sometimes don't work and it's because your motivation gets zapped. This program not
	only returns it, but teaches you how to keep it going--- so all goals can be achieved.</p>

<p><strong>"What if the goal is to make more money? Will this help with that?"</strong></p>

<p>This program has worked for millions of people for maintaining motivation to achieve numerous types of goals.
	Everything from permanent weight loss to starting a business to turning around a down one to making more money
	to building families.</p>

<p><strong>"My motivation is gone because of grief. Will this help?"</strong></p>

<p>While grieving is a natural process this program helps you to identify if it's being experienced in a way that is
	depleting your motivation. You may find it's not grief at all, but energy or one of the others that's causing
	your motivation to go away.</p>

<p><strong>"I've accomplished a lot in my life. It seems I have no motivation issues."</strong></p>

<p>Wonderful! I've been blessed too. I've narrowed it down to the one that most often comes against me. I also know
	which one renders the others powerless. That's most likely what you do too. Just imagine how much more we could
	achieve once we know how to keep motivation high?</p>

<p><strong>"How much time does this take?"</strong></p>

<p>By applying only one thing, that's one thing, you can begin to eliminate what steals your motivation and build
	the never-ending kind. The audio is delivered in tracks so you can listen at your leisure and return to parts
	you especially enjoy.</p>
