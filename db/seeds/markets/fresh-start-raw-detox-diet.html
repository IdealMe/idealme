<p>Are you tired of pinching your fat, sucking in your tummy, and staring hopelessly at your reflection in the mirror?</p>
<p>Do you instantly regret the cookie, slice of pizza, or burger you just ate, feeling sick to your stomach?</p>
<p>Is the outgoing, fun, flirty guy/girl you could be trapped under extra pounds of fat, flesh and ugly sweat pants?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to these questions, then you're in luck. All of that is about to change for good with one easy-to-implement detox diet that will pave the road to the life (and body) of your dreams!</p>
<p>See, not long ago, I was just like you...</p>
<p>[payload_1]</p>
<p>That one number could make or break a day for me. All too often, my days were ruined before I even left the house.</p>
<p>My name is Tatiana, and 11 months ago I desperately wanted to lose weight and break this unhealthy cycle that seemed never-ending, but with my hectic work schedule and social life it seemed impossible.</p>
<p>I had tried diet after diet. I counted calories. I counted points. I cut out fat. I cut out carbs. I cut out gluten. I stopped eating "the white stuff." Soup only. Cookies only.</p>
<p>You name the way, and I've tried it&hellip; Twice.</p>
<p>All of these diets were always the same: too difficult to shop for, too expensive to afford or too extreme to follow. I would never see the results fast enough. Honestly, most of these diets just left me feeling exhausted and discouraged.</p>
<p>Of course I tried exercising as well. And it did help a bit&hellip;</p>
<p>Honestly though, there's nothing more awkward than working out in front of people who already have amazing physiques. All the skinny girls in their lululemon workout clothes, and me, trying to hide my body in oversized sweats. I felt so ashamed.</p>
<p>Not to mention the crazy cost of a membership combined with the little spare time I had meant the gym just didn't fit my budget or my lifestyle &ndash; it created the perfect excuse to give up. Again.</p>
<p>My social life also began to suffer. I couldn't go shopping or share clothes with my girlfriends like I used to because I was way too self-conscious. I couldn't help but wonder&hellip; was I wasting my life away, feeling trapped in my own body? Worst of all&hellip;</p>
<p>I just wasn't happy.</p>
<p>[payload_2]</p>
<p>I knew things were looking bad on the inside as well.</p>
<p>Everyday it seemed as though another scientific study would condemn everything I ate as toxic. My mother would call me up, telling me what she learned today from Dr. Oz&hellip; hinting at me that I really needed to get my act together.</p>
<p>The sugars, fats, preservatives and other chemical agents in my processed diet were making me unhealthy and putting me at risk for some serious medical conditions, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight gain</li>
<li>Premature aging</li>
<li>Low energy and chronic fatigue</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Hormone imbalances</li>
<li>Heart damage</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only was I scared, I felt really unhealthy and it was starting to make me very depressed and reclusive. Some days I just didn't want to get out of bed, let alone go outside.</p>
<p>[payload_3]</p>
<p>&hellip;To improve my physical and emotional health.</p>
<p>I had heard all the latest buzz on raw food&hellip; So I searched and searched, but could never find an easy raw diet for beginners. It seemed like the experts thought that eating raw was as simple as picking up a carrot stick instead of a chocolate bar&hellip; when you and I both know, that's just not realistic!</p>
<p>Fed up with the alternatives, I decided to try my own raw food detox diet. I cut out all of the aspects that I didn't like about the other programs. I decided to strictly follow this new raw diet for an entire week, 100%, to see how it would stand up.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, I started to feel a lot more energetic and I even lost a pound in the first day. By the end of the week I was already a size and a half smaller!</p>
<p>As time went on, I felt more and more like myself. I had mental clarity, restful sleeps, and more energy than I thought possible. So I kept at it and&hellip;</p>
<p>[payload_4]</p>
<p>After years of searching for a sustainable yet detoxifying diet, I'd found something that really worked for me. Not only did I feel better, but I was actually eating food that I really enjoyed.</p>
<p>Finally I had the confidence to meet new people. I wasn't nervous about how I looked; I was in the best shape of my life and my improved moods gave me what I needed to actually be the fun, social person I always knew I could be.</p>
<p>Today, I can proudly say I'm down 47 pounds and 8 dress sizes and counting.</p>
<p>TRUTHFULLY though, the very best part of the raw food diet isn't about the weight loss &ndash; it's about how clean, energized and fueled my body feels.</p>
<p>It's like I have a steady line of energy flowing through me all day long. No dips or spikes, just steady &ndash; and way more than enough! Long gone are the days when I would "crash" or feel "burnt out." My body is functioning on a whole new level.</p>
<p>During this time, I was fortunate enough to keep a log of my diet and moods along with a long list of all my favorite recipes.</p>
<p>I organized those notes and distilled my experience into an easy to follow Fresh Start! Raw-Detox Diet that guides you through the first 7 days of your detox and beyond!</p>

<p>I know you may be thinking there's no way all of these changes could possibly happen in just 7 days. Listen, I was skeptical when I started my raw detox diet too &ndash; and believe me, I wished that I had such a comprehensive, step-by-step guide like Fresh Start! to follow. Let it be known that I don't make claims without backing them up &ndash; I'm not that kind of girl. I'm so sick of the full-of-fluff diet products out there, that I'm sure as hell not going to add anything to that stinking heap! So I decided to put the Fresh Start! Raw-Detox Diet through the wringer, and tested it as much as I could to make sure it wasn't just me who could make the raw detox work so well.</p>
<p>[payload_11]</p>
<p>A few of my friends couldn't stop asking what my secret was to looking so great, so I (lovingly) nicknamed them my "Guinea Pigs" and gave them the Fresh Start! Raw-Detox Diet complete with all 4 sections.</p>
<p>Guinea Pig #1 (Josie) lost 2 pounds in the first 3 days and Guinea Pig #2 (Natasha) came down an entire size in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>My best friend, Guinea Pig #3 (Katelyn), who hated vegetables before, surprisingly has had the most success. She'd always been pretty shy, but now that she's on the diet she's gained the confidence to meet new people and has made a ton of new awesome friends that are so charismatic and adventuresome. She goes out with them all the time. She never would have done that a few months ago!</p>
<p>Not only are my <s>Guinea Pigs</s> friends experiencing improved health and losing weight, their lives are improving in ways they never expected. I can't even begin to tell you how happy and confident they are &ndash; and how often I catch guys checking us out!</p>
<p>Even better than our newfound vanity is our spirit &ndash; it sounds so cheesy but it's true!</p>
<p>Instead of eating Doritos on the couch watching The Bachelor, we go on group runs and actually completed a half marathon together this past spring! Yup, we all kicked butt on the Fresh Start! Raw-Detox Diet.</p>
<p>[payload_12]</p>
<p>So I totally get you! You're STILL skeptical. Let's face it, the weight loss industry plus the health food industry is full of crappy diet programs that never work, and claims that nobody in their right mind should trust.</p>
<p>There are probably 101 EXCUSES as to why this Fresh Start! Raw-Detox Diet won't work for you&hellip; but let me take a minute and knock a few of them down:</p>
<div style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;text-align:center">[payload_13]</div>
<p>For me, it was giving up chocolate. I imagine giving away a puppy to be easier than it was for me to give up chocolate. I have the biggest sweet tooth ever. And pigging out on sweets in front of the television was a regular past time for me.</p>
<p>To be completely honest &ndash; it wasn't even half as difficult as I though it would be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You just have to replace those nasty, toxic foods with delicious, healthy, raw alternatives. And when I say "alternatives", I mean foods that taste even better. For instance &ndash; I make chocolate mousse &ndash; completely raw and so delicious! I'm really not giving up anything!</p>
<p>Oh, and the best thing about the raw food diet? All of the "replacement foods" actually help your body, so you can live and eat GUILT FREE.</p>
<div style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;text-align:center">[payload_14]</div>
<p>My best friend (Guinea Pig #3) Katelyn hated veggies with a passion. She only ever ate vegetables if they had been slathered in butter and cooked or mashed beyond recognition.</p>
<p>So how in the world is she a raw food detox diet success story?</p>
<p>1 word: Spices. Trust me on this.</p>
<p>Once you embrace the world of spices, you can see how seasoning and combining foods can completely change the flavor of the food you hate now.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's a 2nd second word: Blender.</p>
<p>Blend up those greens! By mixing in the vegetables you despise with the fruits you love (or vice versa), you can completely disguise the flavor. Yes, not every smoothie will taste good, but the recipes I've included are tried, tested and totally tasty!</p>
<p>And in case you're wondering - I've covered spices and juicing/blending in full detail in the Fresh Start! Raw-Detox Diet.</p>
<div style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;text-align:center">[payload_15]</div>
<p>That's why I've scheduled the detox diet over just 7 days.</p>
<p>First of all, you need to detox your body of the garbage you've been ingesting for years.</p>
<p>Once you do that, and you'll feel light and refreshed, which makes transitioning into a raw food lifestyle so much easier (and it makes so much more sense too!)</p>
<p>Plus, what's one week? Don't think of it as this huge, monumental change.</p>
<p>It's JUST 7 days!</p>
<p>A quarter of a month.</p>
<p>Just under 2% of a year.</p>
<p>Take it one step at a time, and adjust as you see fit!</p>
<p>&hellip;And just one more note: to be perfectly honest, you shouldn't try this program if your mindset is that this will be 'just another diet' &ndash; you're setting yourself up for failure!</p>
<p>You have to be ready to lose weight, feel refreshed and look radiant for the rest of your life for the Fresh Start! Raw-Detox Diet to work for you.</p>
<div style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;text-align:center">[payload_16]</div>
<p>There's a HUGE misconception about the cost of a raw food lifestyle. People think you have to go to the high-end grocery stores or the specialty stores to buy food at 2 or 3 times the regular cost. So NOT true!</p>
<p>As you will see in the grocery list, every single item you need for the detox can be purchased at your regular grocery store. Any specialty items (which are entirely optional) can be purchased online at a steep discount (these links are provided with Fresh Start!).</p>
<p>Plus, if you compare the costs of eating raw on a daily basis, it is surely much, much less expensive than your daily fast-food habit. That burger, piece of pizza or burrito is likely three to four times as expensive as one serving of ANY of the raw recipes I've included in this guide.</p>
<p>&hellip;And this leads me to the price of the Fresh Start! Raw-Detox Diet.</p>
<p>[payload_17]</p>
<p>Sounds suspiciously low right? Comparable diet programs are double or triple the price and have on-going membership fees&hellip; so what's going on here?</p>
<p>As I've mentioned, I'm a recent grad and I know what it's like to be prohibited by cost.</p>
<p>That just seems down right unethical to me &ndash; how can these giant diet companies ignore tons of people who want to get healthy, just because they don't have the funds? It's just not fair.</p>
<p>Also, and this is a little selfish of me to admit, but the more people who turn a new leaf and live a raw food lifestyle means the more popular and widespread it will become. Don't be surprised when you see more and more raw food restaurants and options popping up &ndash; which is something I'm looking forward to!</p>
<p>In fact, I'm so excited and so confident that you'll experience life-altering changes that I'm going to go a step further and remove all the risk involved and give you a&hellip;</p>
