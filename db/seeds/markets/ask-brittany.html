<h2>If You Could Ask The #1 Traffic & Conversions Expert Brittany Lynch Any Question About Internet Marketing, Promoting Your Business, Increasing Your Profits, Anything At All… </h2>

<h2>What Would It Be?</h2>

<p>Hey! It's Brittany Lynch – and I hear ya!
</p>
<p>Good advice and honest answers are hard to come by. It seems as though today's internet marketing gurus are climbing the ranks and, at the same time, putting more and more distance between them and you. It can be so frustrating just trying to get an answer from somebody…. anybody! 
<br /><br />
What I'm about to share with you today will provide you with the all answers you've been looking for. But first, I want to tell you:</p>

<h3>Exactly where I was on this day, 2009</h3>

<p>I was sitting in my apartment, at my desk, staring blankly at the laptop monitor. There I was, struggling to make a go of it with my online business. I was in university, short on time and even shorter on cash. Living in Sweden and barely grasping the language, I couldn't even pick up a part time job at McDonald's with my broken Swedish. 
<br /><br />
Even though I was making a little money here and there online and experiencing little victories in small niche markets, I knew there must be another way to really pick up the pace and make more money – enough to pay for school and my living expenses at least. 
<br /><br />
I had to be missing something, but what? I needed the help of an expert who could see what <span style="text-decoration:underline">I was so clearly missing. </span>
<br /><br />
Somehow I landed on a famous internet marketing guru's page, much like you have found yourself on this page here today. He was holding a seminar for $2,000.<b> Make no mistake:</b> at the time, $2,000 was a <span style="text-decoration:underline">LOT </span>of money to me. But I knew that if I was really going to make it and create the passive income I so desperately wanted to live the lifestyle I daydreamed of during class, I'd need the advice and opinion of someone who knew the industry inside out. </p>

<h3>…So I saved, borrowed, and worked my ass off to attend</h3>

<p>Thankfully I was able to pull together enough money to cover the seminar ticket in time and secured a coveted seat.
<br /><br />
It's no "secret" - my business wouldn't be what it is today without having attended that seminar or having a mentor to look up to, to strategize with, <b>to rely on.</b> 
<br /><br />
Since that day, my success has been so steady, so rapid and so abundant because I've continued to invest in mentorship…</p>

<h3>Which I've come to learn, really means that I'm investing in myself.</h3>

<p>Now that I've built my online business beyond my expectations and expanded into 100's of lucrative niche markets, I realize how important it is to provide mentorship, guidance and answers to other internet marketers. 
<br /><br />
<b>It doesn't make a difference if you are just getting your feet wet or you've made some money already…</b> if you feel overwhelmed by the constant changes and challenges online, having your questions answered can save you time and money. Even more importantly, having your questions answered will keep you from making<span style="text-decoration:underline"> the same mistakes over and over again.</span> 
<br /><br />
In this economy and competitive landscape of the online info market place, I understand that you may not have the thousands of dollars to afford a seminar or mastermind group – and that a seminar or mastermind group may be over your head at this stage of your business. 
<br /><br />
…I also understand that the $2000/hr business consultation price tag (that I've been strongly advised to charge by my own mentor) is just way too high for those of you who have just started out – or struggle to make a profit. Plus, I personally think that:</p>

<h3>It doesn't seem right that only the rich get richer…</h3>

<p>
That's why I've created the <b>Insider's Circle,</b> the <span style="text-decoration:underline">ONLY</span> membership site where you can have me, the #1 Traffic and Conversions Expert and former Google Adwords Specialist, as your online business mentor. But that's not all – check out all of the…</p>

<h3>3. Brittany Lynch</h3>

<p>If you don't want to sit around and wait to make income with your business, why not go with the guru who turned her business into a 7-figure profit machine before her 25th birthday? (That's me, by the way!) 
<br />
By signing up as an Insider's Circle member, you get my full and undivided attention and the chance to ask me your most pressing questions each month to ramp up your online business revenues in no time, plus: </p>
<ul>
<li>	<b>You Get Access to My Proven Internet Marketing Methods </b>– While you may have been great at traditional marketing, the online space is a completely new arena. An Internet marketing coach (me) can help you with the latest techniques that are working in the online space.</li>
<li>	<b>You Can Brainstorm Your Ideas</b> – When you work on an entrepreneurial project alone, it can get pretty lonely. However, when you have a coach or mentor, you can bounce off your ideas with him and discuss the pros and cons of the strategies that you are thinking of implementing.</li>
<li>	<b>You have a Devil's Advocate </b>– An Internet marketing mentor is your best critic. Getting a detailed second opinion about the manner in which you are doing things can help you improve your tactics.</li>
<li>	<b>You Have Someone to Hold Your Hand</b> – Another benefit of hiring an Internet marketing coach or mentor is that your coach (me) will hold your hand until you stabilize in your venture. This means that you will always have someone to discuss things over at the creation stage until it becomes steady and operational.</li>
<li>	<b>You Gain Immensely from my Experience</b> – An internet marketing coach/mentor brings the experience that you need to understand the manner in which the Internet arena works. This obliterates the need to start experimenting from the basic level to see what works and what does not.</li>
<li>	<b>You Save Time and Money</b> – While you may have to spend some money in hiring an Internet marketing coach or mentor, the amount of time and money that you are likely to save is worth every penny that you spend. You do not make the common mistakes that most people without a coach or mentor do. </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>5. Community Based Learning (NEW Feature) </h3>
<p>
The Insider's Circle membership site is now hosted by ideal.me (my exciting new goal achievement social network). I've always been a strong believer in buying access to powerful people and profitable networks. The beauty of this membership is that you not only get access to my team and me personally, you now also get access to hundreds of other ambitious, driven online entrepreneurs hungry for profits… and, you guessed it, joint venture opportunities and support networking too!
<br /><br />

<h3>6. Early Bird Specials & Price Discounts</h3>
<p>

<h3>8. The Price</h3>

<p>Like I said previously – I'm here to help you out – no matter if you are just getting started, if you are a veteran that's struggling to make a profit, or if you're making money but need a boost into the next income bracket. This membership will be priceless to you, and because the value is so undeterminably high, I've decided I'm not even going to bother putting a price tag on it! <br />
Yes. That's right, you can:</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Gain Full Access to the Insider's Circle for</h2> 
<h1 style="text-align:center">$0</h1>

<p>You're not imagining it. This is not a trick. If you join today you'll pay ZERO, ZILCH, NOTHING for a 30-Day trial membership. You will have an entire month to soak-up as much as you can and ask me as many questions as you can while experiencing the perks and privileges of the full membership to the Insider's Circle for free.
<br /><br />
If, at the end of your trial membership, you decide you want to stay "in", you don't have to lift a finger. After 30 days, we will charge you $47/month to maintain your full membership. Plus, there's no sticky cancellation fees or policies. Whenever you want out, you can cancel your subscription and not owe a single cent more. (I highly doubt there will be any reason for you to cancel – but I want you to know that I'm not here to trap you with hidden fees or to cause you any inconvenience.)</p>

<h3>HOWEVER…</h3> 

<p>If my team and I think you are taking advantage of this free trial membership without actually implementing, contributing, or making any effort to grow your business, ask questions or experience the online community <b>…we will question your membership.</b>
<br /><br />
<b>Here's why:</b>  This membership separates you from the naysayers, from the lackluster losers peering over your shoulder and wishing they the gull to take a chance on a business they're so passionate about. 
<br />
This membership separates you from the people who dream but put no effort towards achieving it – those butts still glued to the couch. Those who come home from their miserable job and feel 'too tired' to start today, and keep putting it off and putting it off….
<br /><br />
At the end of the day, I am here to help and to coach those <b>who want to be helped.</b> For your sake, my sake and my team's sake – please do not waste our time. Because what I'm putting on the table is a great offer – and if you take up my time when you aren't taking yourself or your business seriously…  well, you won't be 'inside' the Insider's Circle for very long.
<br /><br />
I wish I could make the ongoing membership free – however, I have to charge a fee or else I would spend too much time moderating low lying leeches filling up membership space. The monthly fee ensures that this community is filled with the right type of internet marketers – hopefully, <span style="text-decoration:underline">that's you!</span></p>

<b>It's because of this policy that I can…</b>

<h3>Fully guarantee your success</h3>

<p>I know that I can talk all day and make all kinds of promises, but <b>none of that means a thing</b> if I can't back it up, right? I'm from the old school of put up or shut-up – and that's exactly why I'm giving you a free 30-day trial membership.
<br /><br />
This awesome membership makes it <b>IMPOSSIBLE</b> for you to fail to generate money online whether you're an affiliate, small business owner or information marketer. How can you when you have the latest updates, a full support team, a community and a proven successful internet marketing guru at your fingertips, ready and waiting to tackle your troubles and answer your questions?
<br /><br />
Before you get started and ask me that question (or 2 or 3 or 4), I've got a question for you:</p>

<h2>Where would you like to be on this day, 2013?</h2>

<p>If you'd like to be looking back at the rapid, streamlined growth of your successful online business, thankful for your ongoing mentorship, living your dream lifestyle with passive income rolling in every day, and possibly even coaching other internet marketers yourself, you need to:</p>
