<p>Have you ever wondered what the winning combination for a toned, slim physique, glowing skin, mental clarity and strength of body and mind is?</p>
<p>You'll be stunned to find out that you can achieve it all &hellip;without spending hours at the gym, cosmetic surgery, starving yourself, or worse.</p>
<p>Are you ready for it? I'm about to tell you the formula supermodels swear by&hellip; in just a bit.</p>
<p>But first: who am I? And how would I know what supermodels do to achieve and maintain their picture-perfect, flawless figures?</p>
<p>My name is Mary Jane, and I work as a representative for a very famous modeling agency. I am also a long-time friend of Tatiana's, so when she came to me looking for suggestions on a workout program that would complement her rocking Start Fresh! Raw-Detox Diet, a light bulb went off in my head.</p>
<p>I've been sitting on this formula that has been passed around the elite modeling community for far too long&hellip;</p>
<p>And now is the perfect time to finally share it with you.</p>
<p>Let me start off by telling you it's a huge misconception that models are born perfect, that they are heavy drug users, or that they all have eating disorders.</p>
<p>The modeling world has shifted from the 90's (the 'heroin chic' era) and many agencies &ndash; including the one I am employed by &ndash; will not hire a sickly looking model. The healthy look is in &ndash; and it's here to stay!</p>
<p>Yes, models have genetics and photo editing software to thank, but also one very effective, low intensity exercise that does not add bulky muscles. It defines, strengthens and tones the body.</p>
<p>It takes very little time out of your day, and unlike running or hardcore cardio, it does not impact your joints negatively.</p>
<p>Plus, this exercise is proven to help manage stress, boost energy, rev up your sex drive and lower your blood pressure.</p>
<p>I bet you've already got a guess or two&hellip; so here it is: the top-secret formula&hellip;</p>
<p>Hatha Yoga plus a Raw Food Diet (like the Start Fresh! Raw-Detox Diet!)</p>
<p>The good news is you're half way there now that you have started the Start Fresh! Raw-Detox Diet.</p>
<p>The even better news is that I'm about to share with you an exciting new video series on how you can begin practicing Hatha Yoga &ndash; the secret exercise of the supermodels.</p>
<p>Exclusive: 70 Hatha Inspired Yoga Videos Supermodels Swear By</p>
<p>The Hatha Inspired Yoga Video Series is exactly the same series my modeling agency gives to our newest sign-ons to make sure they are in tiptop shape for the next runway show or photo shoot. And now they are available to you!</p>
<p>So what's included?</p>
<p>70 professionally produced downloadable videos showcasing Hatha Inspired Yoga poses, demonstrated and explained by a professional yoga instructor.</p>
<p>The poses included in this video series range from basic to intermediate moves, and set the foundation for you to learn not only Hatha Yoga, but venture into different styles of yoga, including Bikram Yoga and the super-trendy Hot Yoga.</p>
<p>This Hatha Inspired Yoga Video Series is the ultimate work out for you because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's the beginning of your yoga exercise regime &ndash; you can steadily increase the intensity at your own pace while continuing to lose weight or maintain your ideal body weight.</li>
<li>Once you get the Hatha Yoga poses down pat, you can master many different types of yoga including Bikram Yoga, Vinyasa Yoga, Hot Yoga and more.</li>
<li>You can learn yoga in the privacy of your own home, whenever your schedule permits &ndash; whether that's first thing in the morning, right before bed, or somewhere in between.</li>
<li>It is the least expensive way to learn yoga &ndash; saving you costly membership fees (as well as the frustration or embarrassment of learning in front of a full class of strangers!)</li>
<li>It's super easy to follow along &ndash; you can learn at your own speed and complete as many videos as you feel comfortable doing per day.</li>
<li>There's no additional equipment required and Hatha Yoga can be practiced almost anywhere!</li>

<p>Hatha Yoga is also known for both short and long term health benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boosting your metabolism, making it very helpful for weight loss and weight management</li>
<li>Improving muscle tone and increasing strength without painful strains or muscle imbalances</li>
<li>Improving blood flow to help reduce anxiety and stressful emotions</li>

</ul>
<p>You can get all 70 instructional videos inside the Hatha Inspired Yoga Video Series for just $7 if you order right now.</p>
<p>PLEASE BE AWARE: I've made an arrangement with the modeling agency so I can only sell 45 copies. Once that's happened, I'll have to pull down this page and the offer will be gone forever.</p>
<p>In case you're hesitant about the price, I'd like to remind you of some important numbers you need to consider:</p>
<p>$47 &hellip;is the average price of yoga DVDs online or in store &ndash; most of which have just a fraction of the amount of content offered here.</p>
<p>$61 &hellip;is the average monthly gym membership for your standard gym. Yoga classes offered at these gyms typically cost additional fees on a per class basis. Ouch!</p>
<p>$99 &hellip;is the average monthly membership fee for your typical yoga studio.</p>
<p>$199 &hellip;is the starting price for one piece of home exercise equipment.</p>
<p>As you can see, not only do you receive tremendous value and health benefits from the Hatha Inspired Yoga Video Series, you are also saving hundreds of dollars compared to other traditional forms of exercise. Plus, you have the added knowledge that this works - proven by the beautiful bodies you see gracing magazines, runways and billboards.</p>
<p>If you're still not sure, let me take this one step further&hellip;</p>
<p>I will offer you a 30 day 100% money back guarantee. I am so confident you will see results within the first 30 days (ESPECIALLY when combined with the Start Fresh! Raw-Detox Diet) that I am willing to make the entire transaction completely risk free for you.</p>

<p>You must be wondering why I'm revealing this supermodel secret&hellip;</p>
<p>The reason why I am sharing Hatha Inspired Yoga Video Series is because I know how beneficial it can be &ndash; especially to those who are sick and tired of exercising the wrong way without seeing any results (or even worse, experiencing injuries from training too vigorously or incorrectly).</p>
<p>Plus, if you're anything like me and you work a 9-5 job, carving out an hour or two to go to a yoga studio&hellip; well it's almost impossible. And depending on the yoga studio, monthly classes can cost more than a monthly gym membership. It's hard to justify that kind of money &ndash; especially if you haven't even tried yoga! I want you to be able to try yoga from the comfort of your own home, because I'm sure you will not only experience results, but you'll really enjoy it too.</p>
<p>But to be perfectly honest&hellip;</p>
<p>What you'll enjoy even more is turning heads everywhere you go. Be prepared to handle the constant compliments. Be prepared for people telling you that you should consider a career in modeling. Be prepared for people pestering you all the time for your secret. <br /> &nbsp; You've got the supermodel secret, now it's time to live the supermodel life!</p>
