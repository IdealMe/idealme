<h3 style="text-align:center">Now That You're On Your Way<br />
	To Becoming Your Ideal Me...</h3>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Why Not Kick Start Your Goal Achievement With the Help of
	<span class="text-underline">5</span> Celebrity Experts Who Are Sharing Their Proven Strategies for Success in
	Health, Wealth, Love, Happiness and Mastering Any New Skill</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Read This Page Only If You're <span class="text-underline">Dead Set</span><br />
	<span class="text-underline">Serious</span> About Reaching Your Goals</h2>

<p>Whether your Ideal Me goals include spending more time with family, gaining more confidence, losing that spare
	tire, starting your own business, or learning how to play the drums, you need to take a look at what the proven
	experts in each field are revealing about their success and their students' success in love, health, wealth,
	happiness and more – especially if you want to ramp up your progress and side-step common stumbling blocks.</p>

<p><strong>The reason why you've been warned is that once you read past this point, know that there are no more
	excuses.</strong> You now have the rare opportunity to gain the wisdom and advice of 5 mentors – making any goal
	more easily achievable in a quicker timeframe than you ever imagined.</p>

<p>But before we dive in, I've got to tell you how this rare and exciting opportunity came to be...</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">During The 6 Years of Non-Stop Goal Research &amp; Development Something Incredible
	Happened</h2>

<p>Not only was I fortunate enough to study and learn from the best of the best in goal achievement while creating
	Ideal.Me, but after hundreds of emails, phone calls and networking events, I was actually able to track down and
	<span class="text-underline">meet</span> the best of the best too!</p>

<p>What I can tell you is that these people are phenomenal at setting ambitious goals and accomplishing them, but
	that's not all. They are also helping thousands of other "regular" people (including me) achieve equally
	unbelievable results!</p>

<p>You see, one of my Ideal Me goals that I set for myself while creating the system was to <strong>run for 30
	minutes 4 mornings per week</strong>. Let me tell you, this was a really ambitious goal because I really had
	never seriously committed to a running routine before. The last time I had run more than 100 meters was probably
	in high school gym class. The fact that the only time I could schedule in a run was first thing in the morning
	was also a huge deterrent.</p>

<p>As I set out for my first run, <strong>my leg muscles were on fire, my lungs felt constricted and my feet
	ached.</strong> Other joggers were flying by me, and I felt nothing but sweaty and miserable. This was not
	looking like an enjoyable way to start the day...</p>

<p>At work though, I had hit a personal milestone – I was on the phone with Thin &amp; Health co-founder, Donna
	Krech – a really big lead in my goal achievement research. We were talking about health &amp; fitness goals,
	when I decided to sneak in a personal question about my running goal. </p>

<p>Donna was nothing but completely honest, and her advice surprised me – it definitely was not what I had expected.
	She told me how to not just revise my goal, but how to build my endurance and motivation, how to set my
	expectations and how to easily overcome the major obstacles most beginners – in weight loss and in fitness -
	can't get past. But that wasn't all! In fact this business call ran late into the evening hours as we got into
	nutritional goals and how to eat better for my exercise and weight loss goals and overall health.</p>

<p>I took Donna's advice and applied it to my running goal the next day. In just a few weeks I went from sluggish
	amateur with zero endurance to running 60 minutes 5 times per week – above and beyond my initial goal.</p>

<h3>If that's the effect of just ONE expert's advice, in ONE area of my life, can you imagine your life with the
	help of <span class="text-underline">5</span> experts covering all areas of goal achievement?!</h3>

<p>The advice, insights and inspiringly honest words that all 5 experts generously provided were so valuable and
	spoke to each type of goal so specifically that it developed into an entire project itself, <strong>5 Pillars Of
		Success - Life Hacks That Help You Achieve Anything</strong>, which I'm sharing now for the first time ever.

<p>It's important that you know that the hand-selected A-class contributors are respected, renown, and envied in

		for this project</strong> was because of their proven track record of helping people just like you to
	achieve the their goals based on the 5 Pillars of Success. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">...Plus, There's One More Expert That You<br /> Can Most Definitely Count On</h3>

<p>That's me! As a self-made millionaire and founder of Ideal.Me, I've been able to achieve many goals I've set for
	myself - all at a very young age. This life wasn't handed to me though – there was a lot of work to achieve my
	success that happened behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I was always entrepreneurial - even as a kid I made my own jewelry, soap, homemade potato chips - you name it. My
	poor neighbors were constantly opening their front doors to me, enthusiastically selling my latest creation.</p>

<p>While the business side just seemed to come naturally, other goals did not come so easily. Perhaps you can relate
	to this – while one area of your life (maybe relationships and self-esteem for instance) is at an A+ grade,
	you're getting flunking in all other subjects. </p>

<p>When I was hunting down the expert team, I was still struggling with my own goals – like not exercising enough or
	eating healthy, dealing with crippling nerves before public speaking events, and never really learning French –
	no matter how hard I tried! While people just assumed I was some hot-shot online entrepreneur, inside my head I
	was a nobody - <strong>big time failure</strong>.</p>

<p>Just like when I met Donna, my experience individually with each expert really changed my entire mindset – and
	drove home the importance of the 5 Pillars of Success. Inch by inch, day by day, I started to make real
	progress. Not just in my running goal, but losing 10 pounds, gaining confidence as a public speaker, learning to
	speak French, and even mastering a few chords on the guitar. Reaching the smaller milestones gave me the belief
	in myself that I need to really make my dreams come true.</p>

<p>Thanks to the help of these experts, I now live a lifestyle by my own design - never chained to my desk, always
	travelling at the drop of a hat and being more than ambitious with each new goal I set for myself. I'm excited
	to help you realize your Ideal Me and achieve your goals in your business or personal life - whatever they may
	be! I've experienced the profound impact of an expert team, and it's time for you as well.</p>

<p>Now, if this dedicated expert team isn't exciting enough, there's something else you must know:</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">This Is <span class="text-underline">NOT</span> Your Typical Self-Help Course</h2>

<p>Most goal setting programs speak so vaguely in terms of your goals that it can be extremely frustrating to try
	and apply to your real life, wouldn't you agree?</p>

<p>This guide is one-of-a-kind because it addresses the commonalities of achieving ANY goal today in a step-by-step
	blueprint based on the 5 Pillars of Success <span class="text-underline text-italic">PLUS</span> it also pays
	close attention to the targeted actions you should take depending on the type of goal you want to achieve based
	on the expert opinions of the best in business – because, let's face it – learning how to speak Spanish requires
	much different action than quitting smoking. For this reason, <strong>5 Pillars Of Success - Life Hacks That
		Help You Achieve Anything</strong> goes above and beyond the majority of self-help courses.</p>

<p>This program is laid out in such a way that first we'll cover Ideal Me goal setting, the blueprint for goal
	achievement, and overcoming obstacles using the 5 Pillars of Success. Following these foundation modules, we'll
	take that extra step, and get right into the specifics – how to achieve health, wealth, relationship, happiness
	and skill set goals with very direct examples, expert guidance, tips and routines that you can apply to your

</ul>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Modules 4-9 Are So Top Secret, I Can't Even Give You The Titles As It Would Be Giving
	Way Too Much Away!</h2>

<p>It's true - Modules 4-9 are so chock full of expert material on specific goal achievement strategies in Health
	&amp; Wellness, Wealth &amp; Opportunity, Relationships &amp; Love, Happiness &amp; Esteem, and Learning Any
	Skill that even the module, video and worksheets <span class="text-underline"><strong>names</strong></span> give
	away too much expert content to be shared on this public page.</p>

<p>What I can tell you though is that from start to finish, this program covers the most effective goal achievement
	strategy based on years of research, scientific studies and real life success stories. Better yet,</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">There's Absolutely <span class="text-underline">No Risk</span> That<br /> This Won't
	Work For You.</h2>

<p>The reason why this idea of an expert guide evolved into the intensive program it is today was simply because I
	was sick and tired of seeing goal achievement courses written by <span class="text-underline">one person</span>
	who has experienced success in just <span class="text-underline">one area</span> of their life. They'd take
	their single experience and try to apply it to "any" goal – but at the end of the day, it was just not
	realistic. (Plus, who knows what their circumstances were, and if luck was all it took for their one-time
	success!)</p>

<p>The strategies woven through this program are supported not just by theory, but are rooted in real life results.
	It's been structured in a way to complement everything you will be doing with Ideal.Me so no matter your goal,
	big or small, easy or difficult, <strong>5 Pillars Of Success - Life Hacks That Help You Achieve
		Anything</strong> will speak to it in great detail.</p>

<p>With this product, you are getting the goal-specific advice of the most sought-out experts. And let me tell you -
	these experts are <span class="text-italic">next to impossible</span> to nail down for one-on-one coaching. In
	fact, a few don't even offer personal coaching at all. And the ones who do, well, they charge hundreds if not
	thousands of dollars for their time – <span class="text-underline">on an hourly basis.</span></p>

<p>Another thing you should consider: you'll also be receiving the distilled and direct content related to goal
	achievement without having to purchase each expert's library of books. Plus, you won't have to spend weeks
	reading through each book either! We've taken out all the filler, and distilled the most valuable nuggets of
	information and strategy for you. All the grunt work, all of the hard work – that's all over and nothing you
	have to worry about. You have only the most relevant, actionable goal achievement strategies - the crème de la
	crème – at your fingertips. </p>

<p>In comparison to what you could be paying for this information – the tens of thousands of dollars in books alone,
	the price tag of $197 (just 54 cents per day) is straight-up steal of a deal. Because, let's face it, 54 cents
	per day is a very small investment to becoming your Ideal Me, especially when you consider the average person
	spends $3 per day (or $1,100 annually) just on <span class="text-italic">coffee</span>!</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">And You're Completely Covered By A 30-Day,<br /> 100% Money Back Guarantee</h2>

<p>The beauty of this program is that you can try it out for an entire month with no risk. Set your goals and follow
	the sage advice of the experts. If it's not working for you, no big deal – you're covered by an iron-clad
	guarantee. Just let me know and you'll get all of your money back no hassles, no questions asked.</p>

<p>Listen – it comes down to this: I know that you'll see yourself developing better habits immediately, moving
	miles closer to achieving your goals than you have in the past week, month or year, that you won't need to take
	me up on this guarantee! But I'm more than happy to let you come to that realization yourself.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">So What Are You Waiting For?</h2>

<p>Your chances of matching 5 winning numbers in the lottery are 1 in 34 million. Your chances of lining up 5
	celebrity advisors for your personal goal achievement are even less likely... <strong>until today</strong>.</p>

<p>So I'll ask you one more time: what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>It's time to get started living the life as the Ideal Me you've been dreaming about becoming. To go from setting
	goals to achieving goals... ALL of your goals... with the expert help of the best of the best. It's time for you
	to become your Ideal.Me </p>
