    	<p>When a product is featured on Ideal Me it has earned it. And not every product that applies to Ideal Me is accepted and receives the Seal. The Ideal Me Seal is a symbol of quality and results.  We at Ideal Me rigorously review every product that applies to ensure it does everything it promises to do both on its packaging and its advertisement.</p>

The product must do what it says it is going to do on both it's packaging and marketing.</p>
